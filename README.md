# Process scheduling simulator
Has 3 layers of ready queues for processes based on their priority (high, medium, low). Because interprocess communication was implemented, has 2 types of blocked queues (waiting for message to be received and waiting for message to be sent). Moreover, has semaphores to create concurrent execution of processes.
